# What is Python?

* Created in 1991 by Guido Van Rossum
* Named after Monty Pythonâ€™s Flying Circus
* Is an interpreted, Object-Oriented, High Level Programming Language with dynamic semantics
* Gained popularity because of its clear syntax and readability

## What experts have to say about Python?
* Simple and Easy to learn
* Free and open source
* High Level Language
* Support different programming paradigm
    - Object Oriented
    - Procedure Oriented
    - Functional Oriented
    - Imperative Oriented
* Portable

## Python Tokens
* Keyword
    - Python keywords are special reserve keywords
* Identifiers
    - Names that the programmer defines
* Literals
    - Values classified by types: e.g., numbers, truth values, text
* Operators
    - Symbols that operate on data and produce results
    
### Python Tokens: Keywords
* Python keywords are special reserve keywords
* Convey a special meaning to the compiler/interpreter
* Each keywords have a special meaning and a specific operation
* Keywords CANNOT be used as variable

### Python Tokens: Identifiers
*   Identifiers are the name to identify a variable, function, class or an object
* RULES defined for naming an identifiers:
    - No special character except underscore (_) can be used as an identifier
    - Keywords should not be used as an identifiers
    - Python is case sensitive, i.e. Var and var are two different identifier
    - First character of an identifier can be character, underscore(_) but not digit.
    
### Python Tokens: Literals
Literals are data given in a variable or constant
* String Literals
    - Formed by enclosing a text in the quotes
    - Both single and double quotes can be used
* Numeric Literals
    - Int   |   long    |   Float   |   Complex
* Boolean Literals
    - Can have only two values: 	True    |   False
* Special Literals
    - Python has one special literal: None
    - Used to specify to the field that is not created

### Python Tokens: Operators
* Arithmetic Operator
* Assignment Operator
* Comparison Operator
* Logical Operator
* Bitwise Operator
* Identity Operator
* Membership Operator
